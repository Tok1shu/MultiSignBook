# MultiSignBook

## Overview
MultiSignBook is a Bukkit/Spigot plugin designed to facilitate the creation of in-game contracts and agreements on Minecraft servers. Originally developed for the Haku server, this plugin allows players to create and protect written agreements, ensuring the integrity of the contract by limiting the number of signatures.

## Features
- **Contract Signing:** Allows players to create formal agreements using written books.
- **Secure Agreements:** Locks written books to prevent unauthorized signatures.
- **Signature Tracking:** Records players who have signed the contract.
- **Signature Limit:** Defines the maximum number of signatures in a contract (default limit: 8).
- **Command Usage:**
  - `/sign lock`: Protects the contract from additional signatures.
  - `/sign s`: Adds your signature to the contract (if it's not locked).

## Important Note
MultiSignBook provides formality for role-playing servers, and it does not regulate the execution of contracts through in-game mechanics. It provides the means to create formal agreements but leaves their execution and adherence to server rules up to the players.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Tok1shu/MultiSignBook/releases).
2. Place the JAR file in your server's `plugins` folder.
3. Restart the server.

## Usage
- Hold a written book in your hand.
- Use `/sign lock` to protect the contract from additional signatures.
- Use `/sign s` to add your signature to the contract.
